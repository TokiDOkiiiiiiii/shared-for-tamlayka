# Shared Package

## Purpose

Contains shared code and utilities that are used across multiple microservices. \
Not quite sure yet on what should or should not be here, so, I will need your help to decide and design for this. \
For now I have move some that I think definitely can be shared. \
Some other files that I think could be shared are config, jwt and middleware.# shared-for-tamlayka
